    "    A common and straightforward approach to generating Fibonacci numbers is to use two variables (let's say <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>) to keep track of the \"current\" two numbers (which would start off as <code>1</code> and <code>1</code>). As the program runs, it should repeatedly:\n",

    "        <li>Print the value of <code>a</code>.</li>\n",
    "        <li>Re-assign <code>a</code> to the value of <code>b</code> (i.e. <code>a = b</code>).</li>\n",
    "        <li>Re-assign the value of <code>b</code> to the next number in the sequence.</li>\n",
    "    </ol>\n",
    "    After this process, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> would be <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> respectively. This process is then repeated until <code>6765</code> (the largest Fibonacci below 10000) is printed. The tricky part, however, is figuring out how to update these variables in a way that doesn't overwrite each other. Happy coding!\n",
